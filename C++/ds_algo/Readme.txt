    5.  We will get errors because hearders might be missing, we will have to include them by ourselves

Errors:
    1.  If there are swiggly line under using namespace std;
        It is because the first line of the .cpp file would have be a comment line. 
        The preprocessors should be the first few lines in the .cpp file, so remove the comments,

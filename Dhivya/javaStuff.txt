HashTable
	HashTable<Integer, String> = new HashTable<Integer, String>();
	put()
	remove()
	get()
	contains(value) - Checks if the given value is present in the hashtable's value set
	Set<Integer> keys = table.keySet()
	for(Integer i : keys)
		S.O.P(table.get(i));
	clear()

Memory management
	Stack memory
		Memory for variables like int and float are created here
		The memory is freed when the variables go out of scope
	Heap memory
		Memory for objects of Classes are allocated here
		Garbage collector of Java takes care of destroying the memory

Call stack / Function stack / Stack trace - Keeps track of function calls in the program
	New memory is allocated for every new function call
